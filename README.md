Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Amazon is a popular e-commerce platform that can be scraped to gather data about products, reviews, pricing, and more. Python is a popular programming language for web scraping due to its powerful libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Requests.

To scrape Amazon using Python, you can use the Requests library to send HTTP requests to the Amazon website, and then use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML response and extract the desired data.
